# Display result and score on main page
# Display CliVar comparison on main page as well?
# Sidebar will have user input info, or should it also be on main page
# Where to put chatbot?
# What kind of input do we want the user to put in (i.e DNA sequences? Should we cap how long the sequence can be?)
